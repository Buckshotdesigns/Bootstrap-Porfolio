                                <p> Hello world my name is Bryan. I have a degree in graphic design and computer imaging. I also have received a certificate of completion from Code Academy for their HTML and Css advanced course. Currently I work as a Genius for Apple which means I am Mac and Apple Mobile certified carrying an ACMT ( Apple Certified Mac technician) certificate. I have worked as free lance graphic designer and web designer as well as marketing specialist with seo and social media strategies. Currently I am pursuing a career into software development with the help of Case Western Reserve's coding bootcamp. I guess you could say I love technology and solving problems. </p>
                                <p>In my free time I am training in boxing, kickboxing, and MMA and hope to pursue Muay Thai and Ju-Jitsu. I also have recently found a love to travel. I visited Rome, Venice, Paris, and London which has given a new appreciation and passion for traveling. I also love my dog Paco who is a pit-bull Akita mix who we rescued from Summit County Animal shelter and is my best friend.</p>
